;; Lightweight “electric” popup directory browser.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Popup buffer: *Electric Directory* (reused every time).
;; - Header line shows the current directory (abbreviated).
;; - RET on a file opens it and exits; RET on a directory drills into it.
;; - d deletes file/dir at point (with prompt) and refreshes in place.
;; - ~ deletes backup/autosave files (*~ and #*#) and refreshes.
;; - Backspace (DEL) goes up one directory level.
;; - SPC or q quits and restores your previous window layout.
;; - With a prefix argument, run plain `list-directory`.
;;
;; Install:
;;   (require 'electric-list-directory)
;;
;; Usage:
;;   M-x electric-list-directory
;;   ;; Bind to C-x C-d (replaces `list-directory`):
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-d") #'electric-list-directory)
